              collect information, such as your cryptocurrency wallet address
              (which some legal jurisdictions may consider personal
              information), and that information will be stored on a public
              blockchain that we do not control. A smart contract is computer
              code that automatically processes events when certain conditions
              are met; for example, when a proposal is presented to a
              member&rsquo;s DAO and after all needed votes are made by
              respective DAO member, the smart contract will execute the
              proposed action if the proposal passed. In these situations, your
              personal information will be stored on that blockchain through the
              execution of a smart contract and may not be able to be modified
              or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain. &nbsp;{' '}
